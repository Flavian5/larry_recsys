# Token Efficiency Rules
- BE CONCISE. Do not explain things unless specifically asked.
- In PLAN mode, provide a high-level architectural outline only.
- In ACT mode, go straight to the code blocks.
- Do not list files recursively unless it is critical for a new directory structure.
- Use terminal tools (ls, cat) sparingly; rely on your existing project map first.
- If a task is simple, skip the internal monologue and execute immediately.
# Critical Tool Guard
- Whenever using 'write_to_file', the 'content' parameter is MANDATORY. 
- Do not attempt to 'write_to_file' with an empty string or null value.
- If you are unsure of the content, read the file first using 'read_file'.
- When using execute_command, you MUST include the command string and the requires_approval boolean (true/false).
